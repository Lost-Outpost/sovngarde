In addition to the above changes, this is now the most stable version of 2.0 I have released so far. I am very happy with the state we've finally arrived in. As always, enjoy!

This update is not to be understated. It is a massive overhaul of Septimus. The goal is to create a better and lighter foundation to build on and for me to be fully aware of everthing in the list.
