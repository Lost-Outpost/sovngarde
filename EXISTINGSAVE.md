# Existing Saves
For players importing their vanilla save into Dragonborn, please use the following instructions to help ensure your save does not get broken. 

## Initial Warnings
:warning: **WARNING: Adding this to your existing save is fine, removing it may cause issues and you do this at your own risk. If you are unhappy with the list, it is recommended to load an older save before the list was downloaded.**

Adding mods on top of an existing save is always dangerous and can cause some issues. I've done my absolute best to reduce the sources of instability in this modlist
and have tested quite a few vanilla saves myself for stability and all has been smooth. 

The following are things that could prevent you from importing a vanilla save
* You have added mods at one point and later removed them (the save must be 100% clean)
* You've used console commands to skip significant portions of the game or to cheat for items
* You are in the middle of an important quest sequence such as a dialogue scene or boss battle
* You are either a vampire nor a werewolf

Please do your best to avoid the above situations and import on a save that is in a neutral place.

## The TLDR
* You will need to copy your save file into the the provided MO2 profile under `(Install Location)/profiles/Dragonborn/saves`.
* Try to import an existing save with ZERO mods in a neutral location not in the middle of a quest
* Use the free `Draught of Fate Unwound` on first load to reset your perk points and choose new ones
* If you notice certain quests start earlier than they should, [Timing is Everything](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/25464) and [RAE Quest Requirements](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/61004) were added too late to apply to those quests
* Certain items may take some time to appear on enemies or in vendors on existing saves
* Ensure you are neither a vampire or a werewolf when importing

## Important Mod Considerations
Certain mods may not fully apply if added to existing saves (this is okay). The following are some notable ones.

### Quest Timings
Please take note of [Timing is Everything](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/25464) and [RAE Quest Requirements](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/61004) and the changes they make. 
Certain quests are delayed until higher levels or certain conditions. If you import this on an existing save, 
these changes may not apply. Especially if you've already started them or visited the location in which they start and important NPCs have already spawned in.

### Leveled Lists
Certain leveled lists and character equipment are added to or altered. This means new items showing up in vendors etc etc. 
These changes may take some time to apply to your game if you've already visited these vendors or NPCs.

### Perks and Progression
Dragonborn introduces the perk overhaul [Adamant](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30191). This means that some perk trees are altered
and some perks are invalidated. On initial load, your player will be granted a free `Draught of Fate Unwound`. Before continuing to play, please use this potion to reset
your perk points and re-make any new perk selections you'd like. There will be some new and interesting options available to try!

### Gear and Enchantments
Some gear has been rebalanced. Notably, [Creation Club Rebalancing](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/59370) will apply to already acquired items. [Mysticism](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27839) also applies to existing spells as well as adds new ones and those changes will apply immediately as well.
