# Frequently asked questions

## When should I ping Guitarninja on [The Lost Outpost](https://discord.gg/WF66mMu)?

Only if you find a quality among us meme. Any other situation is not acceptable.

## Can I respec?

Yes, use the Draught of the Fate Unwound potion from [Ish's Respec Mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1960).

## Why isn't X mod included?

There are as many reasons a mod wouldn't be included in a list as there are stars in the sky. Here's some of the most common ones. Pick whichever one is applicable, or your favorite.

1. The list author didn't know that mod existed.
2. It's incompatible with other mods in the list.
3. It's nonfunctional.
4. It has problems such as causing CTDs, infinite loading screens, or more.
5. It doesn't fit the list in question.
6. Something in the list already does what that mod does.
7. The list author doesn't like the mod.
8. It would require too much work to add for not enough benefit.

If you're asking this question as a roundabout way of suggesting a mod, don't.

## Will a save from version X be safe with version Y?

All modlists in the Animonculory use semantic versioning which translates to the following:

- 2.0.x are save game safe

- 2.x.x may require a new save game

- x.0.0 definitely requires a new save game

## Will saves from one beta version be safe with another beta version or the full release?

Very unlikely. Do not ask if beta saves will be save safe.

The purpose behind beta versions is for play testing to help Guitarninja and the team find and squash bugs before a major release, and squashing bugs often includes removing misbehaving mods which in turn breaks saves.

The Sovngarde team would like to thank everyone who plays beta versions and reports issues with the understanding that their saves will not be safe. You are making the modlist better for our entire community.
