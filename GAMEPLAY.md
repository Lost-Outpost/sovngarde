In addition to SimonRim, this list includes:

 - Septimus includes a custom balanced mod with two specific utility spells from [Apocalypse](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1090), Spell Twine and Ocatio's.

- [Forceful Tongue](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/36276) - A lightweight shouts overhaul, designed to balance in a sensible manner this underwhelming but cool mechanic
